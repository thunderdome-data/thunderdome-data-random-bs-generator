====================================

What is this crap?
------------------

Ridiculously simple hack to randomly generate a name (or phrase) from sets of words. Hey, it's free. Get your money's worth.

Perpetrators

Vaughn Hagerty, Nelson Hsu

Assumptions
-----------

* A lack of common sense, a few drinks would probably help

What's in here?
---------------

The project contains the following folders and important files:

* ``index.html`` -- An example app, in this case to name a royal baby
* ``lib/js`` -- Javascript
* ``lib/css`` -- Strangely enough, stylesheets

License

Describe the license here. TK. For now, consider it double-0 ...
